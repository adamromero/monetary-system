<body>
	Explaination of the United States Monetary System.
	<blockquote>"It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning."</blockquote>
	<blockquote>"By this means the government may secretly and unobserved, confiscate the wealth of the people, and not one man in a million will detect the theft."</blockquote>

		<div>Step 1: Government Creates US Treasury Bonds</div>
		treasury bonds are our national debt
		treasury holds bond auction, banks buy these bonds and make a profit off the interest
	</div>
	<div>
		<div>Step 2: Banks trade Bonds to create US Currency</div>
		federal reserve creates checks on an account with no bank deposit, creating currency
		fed give currency to the banks, which they use to buy more bonds
		us treasury and the fed swap bonds and currency with banks as middle men
		this process raises the national debt

		<div>Step 3: Government Spends The New Money on Defecit Spending</div>
		government workers deposit their pay in the banks
		when you deposit money into the bank, you loan them your money and they can do what they want with it 
		within legal limits, stock market gambling, and loaning it out
	</div>
	<div>
		<div>Step 4: Banks Create Money Through Loans</div>
		fractional reserve lending is when banks reserve a fraction of your deposit and loan the rest out
		reserves are called vault cash
		banks use fractional reserve banking to create more money off a deposit
		92-96% of all currency is created not by the government but by the banking system

		<div>Step 5: Workers Work for the Money Supply </div>
		workers pay taxes to the irs, which goes to the us treasury so they can pay the principle plus interest 
		on the bond paid for with a check on an account with nothing in it
		workers started paying income tax in 1913, when the federal reserve was created
		impossible to not keep creating money to pay off the debt, it would collapse our economy
