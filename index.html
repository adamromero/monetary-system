            >
            <div>
               When the U.S. Government uses money for deficit spending, be it
               military, infrastructure, etc., it goes to the U.S. Treasury
               where it issues treasury bonds. These bonds are what make up the
               nation's national debt since bonds are IOU's (I own you) and
               therefore must eventually be paid back with interest. The
               treasury holds bond auctions, big banks buy these bonds and make
               a profit off the interest.

            >
            <div>
               Through Open Market Operations, the treasure bonds are sold to
               the Federal Reserve at a profit for the banks. To pay for the
               bonds The Federal Reserve creates checks on an account with no
               bank deposit, creating currency the Fed gives currency to the
               banks, which they use to buy more bonds us treasury and the fed
               swap bonds and currency with banks as middle men this process
               raises the national debt

               government workers deposit their pay in the banks when you
               deposit money into the bank, you loan them your money and they
               can do what they want with it within legal limits, stock market
               gambling, and loaning it out

            <div>
               fractional reserve lending is when banks reserve a fraction of
               your deposit and loan the rest out reserves are called vault cash
               banks use fractional reserve banking to create more money off a
               deposit 92-96% of all currency is created not by the government
               but by the banking system

            >
            <div>
               workers pay taxes to the irs, which goes to the us treasury so
               they can pay the principle plus interest on the bond paid for
               with a check on an account with nothing in it workers started
               paying income tax in 1913, when the federal reserve was created
               impossible to not keep creating money to pay off the debt, it
               would collapse our economy
